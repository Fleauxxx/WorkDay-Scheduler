## Task
In this assignment we are tasked with creating a simple work schedule with hours of operation ranging from 9am-5pm.
The hours were to be color coded depending on the time of day it was. The application includes a text area for data input and a save button, to save things to the local storage.
All of these things were done using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as well as moment.js.

## Code
Using a combined working knowledge of Javascript that I've accumulated over the duration of the course I constructed a workday scheduler similar to the mock up. I used moment.js, javascript, html and some css that was given to us as starter code.

## Mock Up
When the user opens the browser they are present with a work day scheduler with time blocks ranging from 9am - 5pm.
Time blocks are color coded as past being gray, red being present, and green being a future time block. The user can enter text inside the text area and save it to the local storage.
